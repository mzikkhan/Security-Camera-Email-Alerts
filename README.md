This project implements a basic security camera system using OpenCV for motion detection and email notifications. When motion is detected, the system captures an image, saves it locally, and sends an email alert with the image attached.

# Features

- Captures video from the webcam.
- Detects motion using frame differencing.
- Saves images when motion is detected.
- Sends an email alert with the image of detected motion.
- Cleans up saved images after sending the alert.
